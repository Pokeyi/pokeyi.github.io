# Pokeyi.dev
Main hub for all of my projects as well as host repository to a simple HTML page for [Pokeyi.dev](https://pokeyi.dev) utilizing GitHub Pages.

[![Banner](Pokeyi_Banner.png)](https://pokeyi.dev)

### Features
The page itself was inspired by [OneVR](https://github.com/oneVR/oneVR.github.io) where I first discovered an example of this framework and learned a few things to build off of.
- CSS Framework: [Bulma](https://bulma.io)
- Icon Set: [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)

# My Projects
My current projects are listed below, primarily VRChat world-creation behaviours written with UdonSharp (C#). Disk icons link direct to relevant code.

## Credit & Support
Please credit me as Pokeyi if you use my work. I would also love to see your creations that make use of it if you're inclined to share. This and [related projects](https://github.com/Pokeyi/pokeyi.github.io#my-projects) at release have involved over three months of solid work and self-education as I strive for an opportunity to change careers and make a better life for myself. If you find value in my work, please consider supporting me, I appreciate it more than you can imagine!
